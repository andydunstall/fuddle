# What is Fuddle?
Fuddle is a service registry that can be used for client side service discovery
and cluster observability.

Unlike server side service discovery, where requests are simply load balanced
across a set of nodes in a service, client side service discovery gives
developers control. Using a Fuddle SDK nodes can register themselves, query the
set of nodes in the cluster and subscribe to changes.
